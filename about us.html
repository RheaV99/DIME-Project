                    <p>Turtle Bay is an online store where you can buy cruelty free, vegan and organic products that do not affect our environment or any sort of wildlife in a negative manner. According to PETA major cosmetic brands such as Clinique, NARS, OPI and Estée Lauder pay for animal testing in China. And unfortunately, in the US the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t regulate “cruelty-free” or “not tested on animals” packaging labels, so companies can put them on their packaging even if the product or ingredients have been tested on animals. Some popular brands are also guilty of ignoring the environmental issues their products cost, more than 120 billion units of packaging is produced by the global cosmetics industry every year, most of which isn’t recyclable and according to Harper’s Bazaar, the average moisturiser pot takes nearly 1,000 years to decompose. Also, the toxic chemicals in cosmetics washed down drains ends up in oceans damaging the eco system and causing death to aquatic species and the livestock affected by toxins that end up in soil can suffer reproductive, genetic, and developmental changes as well as many types of cancer. Turtle bay is here to change all that.</p>
                    <p>Here in Turtle Bay we work with organisations like PETA and Cosmetics Europe to ensure that all our products fit the criteria of being cruelty free, vegan and organic and we also use the minimum amount of packaging. We also cater to customers with severe skin conditions and allergies to help find the right products for them.</p>
